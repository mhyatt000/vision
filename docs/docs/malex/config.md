# Config

MALEX config files are defined in YAML. They are an easy way to document and finetune experiments without excessive modification of the code. The config module uses [YACS]() to read config files and apply their specification ontop of the default values. 

The supported configurations and their default values are specified below: 

# Basic Configurations

# Model

# Solver

# Loss

# Data
